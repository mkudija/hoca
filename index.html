								<h3 class="major">Our Mission</h3>

								<p>To train the mind and develop the character of each student according to a rigorous, integrated and content-rich, liberal arts curriculum from the Western, classical tradition in an academic setting that honors and inculcates moral, intellectual and civic virtue.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Our Vision</h3>

								<p>To form wise and virtuous American citizens who seek the truth, love what is beautiful, and do what is good.</p>


								<h3 class="major">About</h3>

								<p>Heart of Ohio Classical Academy is a community (charter) school founding project led by dedicated parents and concerned citizens in Central Ohio who believe that modern schooling in America has lost sight of the proper purposes of a formal education: The teaching of intellectual, moral and civic virtue.</p>
 
								<p>As a Hillsdale College Candidate Member School, HOCA enjoys the support of the Barney Charter School Initiative, which assists groups of local citizens with the launch and operation of classical K-12 charter schools in their communities all around the country. That support includes access to the extraordinarily rich and academically rigorous K-12 American classical curriculum that Hillsdale has developed, as well as consultation and training for boards, administrators and teachers at no cost to its member schools.</p>
 
								<p>A curriculum guide overview of the material taught at each grade in Hillsdale member schools is available <a href="url" style="background-color: red;">here</a>.</p>
								 
								<p>Heart of Ohio Classical Academy is currently on track to open its doors in the fall of 2023 to students in grades K-5, adding a grade each year, up to grade twelve. It will be public, tuition free, open to any student who is eligible to attend any public school in Ohio (space permitting), and will be located in the Columbus metro area.</p>

								<h2 class="major">FAQ</h2>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/04-basilica.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<details><summary>What is a “classical” education?</summary><br>
									<p>Classical education is, above all, the teaching of virtue. It was the prevailing philosophy of education in the West for over 2000 years, from Plato and Aristotle and continuing through the American founding until around the turn of the twentieth century. Classical education values knowledge for its own sake; maintains that truth, beauty and goodness are objective; upholds standards of correctness and excellence; develops moral virtue in its students; and prepares them to be responsible citizens in their political community.</p>

								</details>


								<details><summary>What will students be taught?</summary><br>
									<p>HOCA will use the Hillsdale College K-12 classical curriculum, which includes:
 
									<ul>	
										<li>Core Knowledge history and geography</li>
										<li>Classical literature and philosophy from the Western canon</li>
										<li>Singapore math</li>
										<li>Core Knowledge science</li>
										<li>Explicit grammar and phonics</li>
										<li>American civics</li>
										<li>Latin</li>
										<li>Music and the arts</li>
										<li>Physical education</li>
									</ul>

									<p>A more complete curriculum guide overview is available <a href="url" style="background-color: red;">here</a>.</p>

								</details>


								<details><summary>When will the school open?</summary><br>
									<p>HOCA is on track to open in the fall of 2023.</p>

								</details>


								<details><summary>Who can attend?</summary><br>
									<p>Any student who resides in Ohio is eligible to enroll in a public community school, including HOCA, space permitting.</p>

								</details>


								<details><summary>What will it cost?</summary><br>
									<p>HOCA is a public school and will be tuition free.</p>

								</details>


								<details><summary>Where will the school be located?</summary><br>
									<p>The school will be located in the Columbus metro area.  The founders are in the process of identifying possible sites for the school, based on facility size and suitability, acreage, safety, accessibility and desirability of location, as well as cost.</p>

								</details>

								<details><summary>Who will be the principal, teachers and staff?</summary><br>
									<p>The founders anticipate hiring the principal or headmaster in the late summer or early fall of 2022.  Once the principal is hired, that individual will be responsible for the recruitment and hiring of teachers and staff for the school.</p>
 
									<p>If you have any interest in a position with HOCA and are qualified to teach or serve in an administrative capacity, please feel free to <a href="#contact">contact</a> the founders.</p>

								</details>

								<details><summary>What can I do to support the opening of the school?</summary><br>
									<p>There are at least three ways that you can help:</p>
 
									<ol>
										<li><strong>Donate</strong> – opening a new school requires significant, up-front capital to pay for:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Facility lease or purchase and renovations</li>
												<li>Desks, classroom supplies, and administrative office needs</li>
												<li>Legal, consulting, and marketing fees</li>
												<li>Principal and teacher salaries prior to opening</li>
											</ul>

										<li><strong style="background-color: red;">way 2?</strong></li>

										<li><strong style="background-color: red;">way 3?</strong></li>
									</ol>

								</details>

								<details><summary>How much money needs to be raised in order for the school to open?</summary><br>
									<p>Our goal is to raise $2 million in funds and pledges by the time the school opens in the fall of 2023.  Although HOCA likely could open its doors on a smaller budget, a strong fundraising campaign will expand the facility options and position the school especially well to grow significantly as it serves more grades each year. However, whatever amount we are able to raise, HOCA is committed to opening in 2023 if at all possible.</p>

								</details>

								<details><summary>Is HOCA a tax exempt 501(c)(3) organization?</summary><br>
									<p>The application for tax exempt status is in process.  See the <a href="#Contribute">Contribute page</a> for details.</p>

									<p id="fn-irs"><sup>*</sup>Heart of Ohio Classical Academy was incorporated and organized as an Ohio nonprofit corporation on June 22, 2021.  Heart of Ohio Classical Academy filed an application with the Internal Revenue Service on <i style="background-color: red;">[January 25, 2022]</i>, requesting recognition of its exempt status as a 501(c)(3) charitable and educational organization. We expect but cannot guarantee that the IRS will approve that application, and unless and until such application is approved and an exemption determination letter is issued by the IRS, donations, contributions and other gifts made to Heart of Ohio Classical Academy will not be tax deductible as charitable donations.</p>

									<p>However, if Heart of Ohio Classical Academy’s exemption application is approved by the IRS, that determination of exempt status will be effective retroactive to the June 22, 2021 date that Heart of Ohio Classical Academy was incorporated, and all donations, contributions and other gifts made to Heart of Ohio Classical Academy after that incorporation date will become eligible for tax deductibility as a charitable contribution, including any donations made prior to the date of such IRS approval.</p>

									<p>If and when Heart of Ohio Classical Academy receives the IRS exemption determination letter it will provide an acknowledgement letter to all donors and contributors to Heart of Ohio Classical Academy confirming that such contributions to Heart of Ohio Classical Academy may be tax deductible as charitable contributions.</p>
